# About the project
A simple project to learn Sass, Webpack, and Babel. It is an image gallery of animals that represent a specific country, and when clicked, it takes the user to the Wikipedia page of that specific animal.


# Tech Stack
This project was developed without any framework or database. It was entirely built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The styling was done with Sass. Webpack was used to bundle the project's files, optimizing performance, while Babel was used to transpile modern JavaScript into a version compatible with older browsers.
